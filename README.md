# NoANRAndCrashDialogs

An LSPosed module to hide or auto-dismiss system ANR (App Not Responding) and crash dialogs.

- Tested on a Pixel 7 and Pixel 8 running Android 15.
- Requires Root + Magisk + LSPosed.
- I am not providing build instructions; a prebuilt APK is available in [Releases](https://github.com/diskree/NoANRAndCrashDialogs/releases).
- I have no plans to adapt this for older Android versions or other devices.
